# RaidEye

RaidEye is a desktop companion for Raid: Shadow Legends that captures battles, organizes replays, and gives clans a clear siege dashboard. It combines a lightweight in-game overlay, a control panel for capture and sync, and a web-style "Engine" UI for browsing and watching replays.

## What You Can Do
- Capture raid windows, results screens, and pick/ban screens with an overlay.
- Record live arena matches and save replays.
- Log siege battles, including location, position, condition, and results.
- Browse recent activity and watch replays in the Engine interface.
- Sync data to a server to share and analyze battles across your clan.

## Main Parts
- **Overlay**: A transparent capture layer that sits over the game to select regions and grab screenshots.
- **Control Panel**: The desktop UI for capture, recording, and sync.
- **Engine**: The web-style interface for siege tracking and replay viewing.
- **Sync Server**: Stores battles, siege data, and uploaded files so your clan can review them.

## Typical Workflow
1. Open RaidEye and keep the overlay ready.
2. Use the Control Panel to capture key screens or start recording.
3. Save battles locally and sync when ready.
4. Open the Engine to review siege activity and replays.

## Notes
- The app is designed to run alongside the game and stay out of the way.
- Siege records include location, number, position, condition, and result.
